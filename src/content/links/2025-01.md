- Been diving deep into [plain text](https://plaintextproject.online/) lately and it's changing how I think about digital tools. Derek Sivers has [this great piece](https://sive.rs/plaintext) about why he uses plain text for everything
- Watched [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgV6M1LyfNY) on the unreasonable effectiveness of plain text - it's survived every technological revolution for a reason
- The more I use complex tools, the more I appreciate simple ones. There's something liberating about knowing your writing will outlive any app or platform
